    "- **Part A**: Select the single best model from your Milestone 2 experiments. Now that you’ve finalized your model, revisit your decisions from Milestones 1 and 2. Are there any steps you would change—such as cleaning, feature engineering, or model evaluation—given what you now know?\n",

    "  - [Data science report example](https://www.projectpro.io/article/data-science-project-report/620)\n",
    "  - The Checklist given in this week's Blackboard Lesson (essentially the same as in HOML).\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Your audience here is technically literate but unfamiliar with your work—like your manager or other data scientists. Be clear, precise, and include both code (for illustration), charts/plots/illustrations, and explanation of what you discovered and your reasoning process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that Part A would be a repository of the most important code, for further work to come, and Part B is\n",
    "the technical report which summarizes your project for the data science group at your company. Do NOT assume that readers of Part B are intimately familiar with Part A; provide code for illustration as needed, but not to run.\n",

    "**Rough Draft w/ TaxValue** The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Zillow’s housing dataset to estimate the tax-assessed value of residential properties (taxvaluedollarcnt). By leveraging various home features—such as square footage, location, and year built—the model aims to build on the success of Zillow’s widely-used Zestimate tool by expanding its capabilities to include predictions of a home’s tax-assessed value. This would offer homeowners greater transparency into how their property taxes—one of the most significant ongoing expenses after purchasing a home—are determined.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our approach is to apply regression techniques to identify key factors influencing property valuations, build a model to predict the taxvaluedollarcnt of different properties based on the data provided by Zillow, and to minimize prediction errors, as evaluated by the use of metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our key findings were that while ensemble methods like Gradient Boosted Trees yielded RMSEs that were improvements over baseline estimates, models still contained an average error rate north of \\$300,000. Due to the trend of models performing significantly worse on homes with taxvalluedollarcnt over \\$2,000,000, (consistently undershooting targets) we suspect that this 'average' is doing significantly worse due to the presence of extreme outliers in the data (some close to \\$49,000,000).
